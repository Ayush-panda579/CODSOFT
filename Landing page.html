        <p>SERVED EVERY DAY SINCE 1990</p>

<p>Krishna’s opened on Thanksgiving Day 1990. Chef / Owner Ron Silver began baking pies and selling them to restaurants and his neighbors out of a small kitchen at the corner of Hinjilicut and Radha hotel, Berhampur. Today, NYC’s beloved restaurant and pie shop celebrates 27 years of classic, made from scratch American cooking.</p>
<br>
<p>Why It's Effective</p>
<br>
<p>Rather than calling itself a “Odisha institution” or using the word "reliable," Krishna’s uses its headline to make a specific claim — ”Served every day since 1990” — that demonstrates those ideas. This captures more attention and paints a richer, more vivid picture of its history and role in the community. The rest of the description supports this by adding details to the story of its founding and explaining that even three decades later, its scratch approach to cooking remains the same.</p>
